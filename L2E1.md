1. setImmediate Vs setTimeout:

setTimeout is like calling a function after delay has finished. Whenever a function is called it is not executed immediately, but queued so that it is executed after all the executing and currently queued eventhandlers finish first.

setImmediate queues immedieately after the last I/O handler somewhat like process.nextTick. So it is faster.

2. process.nextTick Vs setImmediate

We use setImmediate if we want to queue the function behind all I/O event callbacks that are already in the event queue. We use Use process.nextTick to queue the function at the head of the event queue so that it executes immediately after the current function completes.
